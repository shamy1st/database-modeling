### Conceptual Model
represents the entities and their relationships.

### Logical Model
detailed ERD with data types (abstract) and more relation details.

### Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.

Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations.

### 1NF- First Normal Form
Each cell should have a single value and we cannot have repeated columns.

tags in table courses violate this rule.
